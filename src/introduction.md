# Remember!

When creating an addon for Aioewa, be aware of that the most of the code that is written in Aioewa project, is written in either JavaScript, HTML, and or CSS, or all of them.
Developing and doing changes in Aioewa extension itself also requires you to have good knowledge about the Chrome Extension API, so that we are sure that the code you write, is useful :smile:.

Here are reference docs to the Chrome's extension API: [Reference documentation for Chrome extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/).
