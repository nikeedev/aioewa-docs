# First Steps: 

Okay, let's start. We will start by creating a fork of Aioewa repository so that we can work on own version of Aioewa repository while still having ability to publish new stuff to the main repository.

## Requirements:
- A Chromium based browser which supports extensions: Chrome recommended.
- `Git` installed ([Download `git`](https://git-scm.com/))
- A code editor, like Visual Studio Code or Notepad++.


Follow these docs in numerical order:

2. [Adding some code!](first_addon/adding_code.md)
3. [Send a PR to the main repository](first_addon/publishing_pr.md)
